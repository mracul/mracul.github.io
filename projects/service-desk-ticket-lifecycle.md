</p>

A curated set of ITSM-style tickets demonstrating intake, categorisation, prioritisation, troubleshooting steps, escalation decisions, and closure notes.

## What This Project Will Include

- **Ticket intake examples** — structured user requests with clear problem statements
- **Categorisation & prioritisation** — applying impact/urgency to determine SLA
- **Troubleshooting notes** — step-by-step triage and diagnostic documentation
- **Escalation decisions** — when and how to escalate, with context for L2/L3
- **Closure notes** — resolution summary, user confirmation, knowledge article links
