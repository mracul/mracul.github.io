# CompTIA A+ Practical Lab Notes (Template Index)

Guiding principle: keep each lab to one page. Use the lab template in each file.

## Lab template (use in each file)
- Title: [Short descriptive title]
- Objective: [What you want to demonstrate or test]
- Symptoms: [User-facing symptoms observed]
- Tools used: [List tools and versions]
- Troubleshooting steps (numbered):
	1. [Step 1 — test/verify]
	2. [Step 2 — actions taken]
	3. [Step 3 — validation]
- Fix applied: [Concise statement of fix]
- Outcome & verification: [How you confirmed success]
- Notes / lessons: [One-line takeaway]

## Labs (create one file per lab in `labs/`)
- Diagnosing slow PC — `labs/slow-pc.md`
- Malware cleanup — `labs/malware-cleanup.md`
- Network connectivity — `labs/network-connectivity.md`
- BIOS/UEFI issue — `labs/bios-uefi.md`
