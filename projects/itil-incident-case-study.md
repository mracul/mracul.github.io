# ITIL Incident Management Case Study  
**Warehouse RF Scanner & System Outage**

---

## Executive Summary

<!--
In 3–4 sentences:
- What happened?
- Where did it happen?
- Why does it matter?
- From what perspective is this written (Service Desk / ITIL)?
Avoid technical detail here — focus on impact.
-->

---

## Environment & Context

<!--
Briefly describe the environment without naming companies or blaming teams.
Think:
- Type of workplace
- Systems involved
- Why uptime matters
-->

- Environment type:
- Key systems involved:
- Operational constraints:

---

## Incident Description

### Incident Summary

<!--
Describe the symptoms, not the cause.
Answer:
- What stopped working?
- How widespread was it?
- How long did it last?
-->

-
-
-

### Detection

<!--
How was the incident noticed?
Think ITIL:
- User reports?
- Monitoring?
- Observed operational impact?
-->

-
-
-

---

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

<!--
This is NOT technical.
Answer:
- Who was affected?
- What work stopped or slowed?
- What were the consequences?
-->

-
-
-

### Impact Classification

<!--
Choose reasonable classifications.
You are demonstrating judgement, not access.
-->

- Incident Type:
- Priority:
- Affected services:

## Incident Handling (ITIL Lifecycle)

### Logging & Categorisation

<!--
Explain how this would be logged and categorised.
Focus on:
- Scope
- Symptom-based categorisation (not root cause)
- What information you capture early
-->

- Category:
- Subcategory:
- Initial description captured:

### Initial Diagnosis / Triage

<!--
Show how you think as L1/L2:
- Separate symptoms from causes
- Confirm scope and reproduce where possible
- Identify likely failure domains (device/user/network/service)
-->

- What was checked first:
- What was ruled out:
- Working hypotheses:

### Escalation & Coordination

<!--
Demonstrate escalation judgement:
- When to escalate (impact/urgency/permissions)
- Who you would engage (network/system/app/vendor)
- How you communicate handoffs
-->

- Escalation trigger:
- Teams/roles engaged:
- Handoff notes / evidence shared:

### Communication

<!--
Recruiter-friendly communication:
- Update cadence
- Audience-specific messaging (users vs stakeholders)
- What you communicate (impact, workaround, ETA, next update time)
-->

- User-facing update:
- Stakeholder update:
- Update cadence:

### Resolution & Recovery

<!--
Keep this ITIL-aligned:
- What restored service
- What validation was performed
- What monitoring/verification followed
-->

- Resolution steps (high level):
- Service validation:
- Post-recovery monitoring:

### Closure

<!--
Show what “good closure” looks like:
- Confirm service restored
- Document root cause (if known) vs suspected
- Capture action items and knowledge updates
-->

- Closure criteria met:
- Documentation captured:
- Knowledge base updates:

---

## Root Cause & Prevention (Post-Incident Review)

<!--
Be careful:
- If you don’t know root cause, say “suspected/likely” and explain why
- Focus on prevention and operational controls
-->

### Root Cause (Confirmed or Likely)

- 

### Contributing Factors

-
-

### Preventative Actions

- **Action**:
  - Owner:
  - Target date:
  - Outcome / validation:
- **Action**:
  - Owner:
  - Target date:
  - Outcome / validation:

## What This Demonstrates (For Hiring Managers)

- ITIL-aligned incident handling: triage, communication, escalation, and closure  
- Clear documentation and structured thinking under operational pressure  
- Ability to translate technical events into business impact and follow-up actions
