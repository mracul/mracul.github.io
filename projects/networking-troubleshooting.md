# Networking Troubleshooting Project

<p class="card-badges" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <span class="badge">Planned</span>
</p>

Symptom-driven connectivity troubleshooting (no internet, DNS failures, DHCP/IP issues, VPN) written as escalation-ready notes and short case write-ups.

---

## What This Project Will Include

- **Symptom-based troubleshooting guides** — starting from what the user reports
- **Diagnostic command documentation** — `ipconfig`, `ping`, `nslookup`, `tracert` with interpretation
- **Fault isolation approach** — separating client, LAN, DNS, gateway, and ISP issues
- **Escalation-ready notes** — structured handoff documentation for L2/network team

---

## Planned Troubleshooting Scenarios

| Symptom | Focus Area |
|---------|------------|
| "No internet" | Gateway, DNS, DHCP lease, physical layer checks |
| "Can't reach website" | DNS resolution, specific host connectivity |
| "VPN won't connect" | Client config, network path, firewall considerations |
| "Slow network" | Bandwidth, latency, duplex mismatch indicators |
| "Wi-Fi keeps dropping" | Signal strength, channel interference, driver issues |
| "Can ping IP but not hostname" | DNS client configuration, cache, server reachability |

---

## What This Demonstrates

- TCP/IP fundamentals applied to real support scenarios
- Systematic fault isolation (OSI-aware triage)
- L1/L2-ready troubleshooting documentation
- Clear escalation handoffs with diagnostic evidence
