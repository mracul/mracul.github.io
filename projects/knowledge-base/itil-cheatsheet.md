# ITIL Cheatsheet (Fillable)

Short reference for incident/problem/change handling. Fill examples with your process notes.

- Incident: goal is to restore service quickly. Record immediate workaround and ticket details.
- Problem: deeper analysis to determine root cause and permanent fix.
- Change: controlled modification with approval, backout plan, and communication.

Priority guidance (example — adapt to employer scale):
- P1: Business-critical outage — immediate all-hands response
- P2: Major degradation — work during business hours with escalation
- P3: Routine issue — handled as part of normal queue

Key outputs to produce after an incident:
- RCA: root cause analysis document with timeline and evidence
- Known Error: problem record and workaround in a knowledge base
- Action plan: assigned actions with owners and due dates
