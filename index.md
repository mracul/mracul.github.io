## About Me

I am an aspiring IT Support professional transitioning from operations and warehouse environments into entry-level IT roles. I bring over four years of experience working in high-pressure, high-volume environments where accuracy, troubleshooting, and clear communication are critical.

Alongside my operational background, I have completed substantial tertiary study in Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (68 units of credit completed), am actively preparing for CompTIA A+, and am **currently studying ITIL Foundations concepts**, including incident, problem, and change management.

I am particularly interested in Service Desk, Desktop Support, and MSP environments where structured troubleshooting, ITIL-aligned processes, and strong user support are essential.
