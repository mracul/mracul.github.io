# IT Support Portfolio Landing Page (Guide)

Use these prompts to draft a minimal landing page for GitHub Pages. Keep it calm, neutral, and explicitly entry-level.

## Intro (2–3 sentences)
- State what this portfolio is for (learning, documenting process). Avoid claiming expertise.
- Mention MSP/service desk focus without implying admin authority.
- Tone: professional, concise, steady; avoid enthusiasm stories.

## What’s inside (bullet prompts)
- Troubleshooting playbooks: note they are outlines meant for documenting user-facing issues.
- Labs: explain they capture hands-on learning, not tutorials.
- Assets: placeholders for future diagrams/screenshots only when they clarify.

## How to read
- Suggest starting with playbooks for triage, then labs for how you validated checks.
- Remind reader content is intentionally incomplete and will grow with real cases.
- Avoid tool lists or certifications; keep focus on process and repeatability.

## Links (add when live)
- GitHub repository URL.
- GitHub Pages URL.
- Optional: note last updated month/year without sounding final.
