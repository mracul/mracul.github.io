# Wi-Fi Basic Connectivity (Playbook Outline)

Use this outline to capture how you handle a simple "can’t get online" ticket. Keep it short and repeatable.

## Issue Description
- Summarize the reported symptom in the user’s words.
- Avoid diagnosing; no assumptions about root cause.

## User Report
- What exactly does the user see (errors, icons, captive portal prompts)?
- When did it start, and is it location/SSID specific?

## Initial Checks (before changing anything)
- What status indicators do you confirm (Wi-Fi toggle, airplane mode, SSID)?
- How do you note whether other devices are affected?
- Reminder: **do not skip information gathering.**

## Likely Causes (most common → least)
- List possible categories (signal, DHCP, DNS, captive portal, account limits) without solutions.
- Keep it brief; this is for ordering your checks.

## Resolution Path (high level)
- Outline the sequence of checks you will perform; avoid commands or step-by-step fixes.
- Note where you would capture evidence (screenshots, IP details) for repeatability.
- Reminder: **do not assume admin access**; phrase actions for standard user permissions.

## Escalation Criteria
- What conditions mean you should stop and escalate (e.g., multiple users, ISP outage indicators)?
- What information must you capture before escalation (timestamps, SSID, gateway/DNS test results)?
- Keep the handoff notes concise and factual.
