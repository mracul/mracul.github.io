# Peripheral Checklist (Fast Triage Outline)

Use this to document a lightweight sequence for common accessory issues. Keep it concise and repeatable.

## Use When
- Define scenarios (intermittent keyboard/mouse/headset/webcam behavior) without giving fixes.
- Mention any scope limits (personal devices vs. corporate devices).

## Initial Checks (observe first)
- What power/connection indicators do you verify before changing settings?
- How do you confirm whether the issue is device-specific or system-specific?
- Reminder: **do not skip information gathering**; capture what you observe.

## Likely Causes (most common → least)
- List categories like battery/charge, connection method, environmental factors, policy blocks, driver recognition.
- Keep to short bullets; no resolutions here.

## Resolution Path (high level)
- Outline the order of actions you might take (reconnect, basic settings review, alternate port/system) without writing the steps.
- Note evidence to capture (screenshots, status lights, timestamps) to maintain repeatability.
- Reminder: **do not assume admin access** when describing any checks.

## Escalation Criteria
- When to escalate (persistent failure across systems, policy or hardware suspected).
- What to include in the handoff (device make/model, tests attempted, observations).
- Keep wording neutral and factual; avoid conclusions.
