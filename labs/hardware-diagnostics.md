# Hardware Diagnostics Lab

Use this outline to capture how you isolated peripheral/port issues. Keep it observational and entry-level.

## Goal
- State the hardware behavior you’re examining (e.g., one USB port unreliable).
- Keep it specific and measurable.

## Setup
- Devices/OS involved and context (work vs. personal). Keep it simple.
- Tools used only if actually used; avoid claiming deep diagnostics.

## Procedure (outline only)
- List the sequence of checks (port/device combinations, simple resets) without detailed steps.
- Note where you watched for changes (basic system views, LEDs, sounds).
- Reminder: keep actions within standard user permissions.

## Observations
- Record what happened for each variation (port A vs. port B, after restart, etc.).
- Stick to facts; no conclusions yet.

## What I Learned
- Bullet the practical takeaways you will reuse in future triage.
- Keep it short and service-desk focused.

## Relevance to IT Support
- Explain how these observations inform escalation-ready notes for hardware issues.
- Emphasize repeatability and minimal disruption for the user.

## Next Steps (optional)
- Add a couple of small follow-up ideas (e.g., gather warranty info) without finishing them here.
