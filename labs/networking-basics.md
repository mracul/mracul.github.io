# Networking Basics Lab (Guide)

Use this template to record how you explored IP/DHCP/DNS basics. Keep it observational, not tutorial-style.

## Goal
- What concept are you trying to understand or prove (e.g., how DHCP leases refresh)?
- Keep it to one or two sentences; avoid conclusions here.

## Setup
- Note devices/OS and simple network context (home Wi-Fi, router brand if relevant).
- List tools only if you actually used them; avoid advanced tooling claims.
- Keep environment simple; this is L1-oriented.

## Procedure (outline only)
- List the high-level steps you took without detailed commands.
- Mention variables you changed (SSID, adapter toggle, etc.).
- Avoid writing resolutions; focus on what you intended to observe.

## Observations
- Capture what you saw when variables changed (e.g., IP lease updates, ping behavior).
- Stick to facts; no analysis yet.

## What I Learned
- Bullet the practical takeaways in your own words after running the checks.
- Keep it short; avoid turning this into a tutorial.

## Relevance to IT Support
- Link the observations to triage tasks (e.g., separating DNS vs. connectivity issues).
- Note how this helps with escalation-ready evidence.

## Next Steps (optional)
- Add one or two small follow-up ideas if you revisit the lab.
- Keep them modest to avoid scope creep.
