# OS Troubleshooting Lab

Use this to frame a simple performance/startup investigation without writing a tutorial.

## Goal
- What OS behavior are you studying (e.g., slow boot, high CPU)?
- Keep it narrow and measurable.

## Setup
- List device/OS and context (work/personal, network if relevant).
- Note only the tools you actually used; avoid admin-only utilities unless allowed.

## Procedure (outline only)
- Map the sequence of checks you performed; keep to high-level actions.
- Indicate where you observed data (task/resource views, basic logs) without steps.
- Reminder: **do not assume admin access** when describing what you inspected.

## Observations
- Record what changed when you toggled settings or captured metrics.
- Keep it factual; no fixes or conclusions here.

## What I Learned
- Summarize key takeaways in short bullets once done.
- Focus on how this shapes future triage, not deep analysis.

## Relevance to IT Support
- Connect observations to L1 tasks (triage, evidence gathering, escalation notes).
- Highlight how this keeps changes minimal and reversible.

## Next Steps (optional)
- List a couple of small follow-ups (e.g., retest after updates) without expanding scope.
