# IT Support Portfolio (Starter Guide)

Use this file to orient a reader in under ~6 lines. Keep it recruiter-scannable and focused on what lives here, not on you.

- Explain the repo purpose in one calm sentence (service-desk mindset, MSP entry-level).
- List the main folders with one-line intents (playbooks, labs, assets). Avoid tool or cert claims.
- Mention GitHub Pages URL placeholder only if live; do not oversell.
- Keep tone neutral and professional; no passion stories or heavy backstory.
- Leave space for future updates rather than sounding complete.

## Structure (with intent prompts)
- `index.md` – landing page prompts for positioning and links.
- `troubleshooting/` – playbook outlines for common user issues.
- `labs/` – lab note outlines for hands-on learning summaries.
- `assets/diagrams/` – reserved for simple visuals when needed.
- `assets/screenshots/` – reserved for evidence captures.

## How to use this repo overview
- Draft brief descriptions after you create content; avoid detailed summaries here.
- Assume a 30-second skim; prioritize clarity over completeness.
- If you add new folders, include a one-line intent here without expanding the length.
